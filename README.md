### Task1
Provided a dataset of source tweets and their replies, where each source tweet is labeled as a rumour or non-rumour, the task is to build a binary classifier using this dataset. For each tweet (source tweet or reply tweet), the dataset provides a range of information, including the text of the tweet, information of the user who made the
tweet, unique ID of the tweet, etc.

For this task, a sentence-pair binary classifier built on pre-trained BERT model was implemented using PyTorch.
